# Botty
Just a little discord bot I made.

Here is how to use the configuration file:
```py
# Token
TOKEN = ""

# API keys
ZQ_API_KEY = "" # ask zenquotes for an api key
DAD_API_KEY = "" # search dad jokes on rapidapi
APRS_API_KEY = "" # go to aprs.fi, make an account, go to account settings and get your api key
```
